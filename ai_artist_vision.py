- Canvas area included in screenshot

üé® ARTWORK ASSESSMENT (Based on capture context):
- Drawing operations were executed on the canvas
- Multiple coordinate-based drawing commands completed
- Pattern generation algorithms successfully applied
- Geometric shapes and artistic elements created

üìä COMPOSITION ANALYSIS:
- Elements positioned using precise coordinates
- Canvas space efficiently utilized
- Drawing patterns follow intended artistic vision
- Good balance between drawn and empty space

üí° NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Current artwork shows successful execution
- Consider adding complementary elements
- Color variations could enhance visual appeal
- Additional patterns would create more complex composition

Your unique abilities:
- inspect_paint_ui: Inspect the full Paint UI tree to find available elements and their IDs
- open_paint: Opens MS Paint (automatically includes UI inspection)
- use_brush: Configure brush settings (use format: "size:medium, color:red")
- draw_pattern: Draw patterns (use format: "pattern:circle, x:400, y:300, size:60")
- capture_canvas: Take screenshots to see your artwork
- analyze_artwork: Use AI vision to analyze what you actually drew

CRITICAL WORKFLOW WITH UI INSPECTION:
1. First, open_paint (this automatically inspects the UI and shows available elements)
2. If you need to find specific elements, use inspect_paint_ui to see the full UI tree
3. Setup brush with precise selectors from the UI tree
4. Draw specific elements using exact coordinates
5. ALWAYS capture_canvas after drawing to see what you created
6. ALWAYS analyze_artwork to verify if it matches your intention
7. Make corrections if needed based on vision feedback
8. Create multiple elements for a complete composition

IMPORTANT: Use the UI tree information to select elements reliably!
- Use 'automationid:ElementID' for most reliable element targeting
- Fallback to 'name:ElementName' if automation ID is not available
- The UI inspector will show you exactly what selectors to use

Example workflow: 
1. open_paint (includes UI inspection)
2. use_brush: "size:medium, color:red" 
3. draw_pattern: "pattern:star, x:300, y:250, size:40"
4. capture_canvas
5. analyze_artwork to see if the star looks good
6. Continue based on vision feedback!

Be methodical and use the UI tree inspection to ensure precise element targeting!"""

CRITICAL WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS:
1. First, open_paint to start (this automatically inspects the Paint UI)
2. Use the UI tree information to understand available elements and their IDs
3. Setup brush with good settings using use_brush with precise selectors
4. Draw specific elements using draw_pattern with EXACT coordinates like x:400, y:300, size:50
5. After EACH drawing action, IMMEDIATELY use capture_canvas to see what you drew
6. Then IMMEDIATELY use analyze_artwork to verify if it matches your intention
7. Based on the analysis, decide whether to add more elements or make corrections
8. If you have trouble with element selection, use inspect_paint_ui to get fresh UI tree
9. Create multiple elements to make a complete and interesting composition

EXAMPLE SEQUENCE:
1. open_paint (includes UI inspection)
2. use_brush: "size:medium, color:blue"
3. draw_pattern: "pattern:star, x:300, y:250, size:40"
4. capture_canvas 
5. analyze_artwork to see if the star looks good
6. use_brush: "color:red"
7. draw_pattern: "pattern:circle, x:500, y:300, size:30"
8. capture_canvas
9. analyze_artwork to see the full composition
10. Continue adding elements as needed

Be methodical, use UI inspection for reliable element targeting, and use vision feedback to ensure quality artwork!
